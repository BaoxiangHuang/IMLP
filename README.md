This project aims to predict chlorophyll concentration at depths of 1 to 300 meters in the ocean using deep learning techniques. We utilize the IMLP model and Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) layers for prediction. The project consists of two main components:

train.py: Used to train the deep learning model.
predict.py: Used to run the model on new data and generate prediction results.
